|Cog|Explanation|
|---|---|
|calender|Yes, it's misspelled, but the command it uses is not, so the install is with the misspelled version, but after that the command is [p]calendar \n it can be used for making events and letting people RSVP.\n Editting events is coming soon.|
|counter| not really complete, it can be used to count the most random stuff [p]count <Name> will add 1 to the counter of that name. better docs and [p]help coming soon
